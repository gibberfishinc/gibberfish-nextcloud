## About Us

Gibberfish, Inc is a committed all-volunteer nonprofit with the goal of developing easy-to-use online tools for activists, organizers, and human rights defenders which offer strong privacy and accessible encryption without the need for in-depth technical knowledge. Further, we aim to provide hosting for these tools at zero cost, so the people who need them most can focus all of their limited resources towards making a positive impact.
